# PublisherSubscriber
A simple publisher subscriber system. A publisher can publish messages on various topics. A subscriber will be able to view the messages of the topic to which he subscribed. Data is stored and retreived from database using sql queries. 

To start, run </br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"node index.js" at command prompt.

The publisher page is available at https://localhost:3000/pub.html 
The subscriber page is available at https://localhost:3000/sub.html

**Note** </br>
    This is a simple application and can be improved a lot. Right now, the topics are all static and there is no mechanism for receiving acknowledgements. These are some of the improvements which can be done
    

**Done as a part of ACMS program within a team**
